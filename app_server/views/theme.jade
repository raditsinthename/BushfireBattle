		h2 About the Website
		h3 Purpose
		p
			| This website was created for a 
			a(href='http://teaching.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS3403/') CITS3403 Agile Web Development
			|  assignment.
			| 	Using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript, the goal of the assignment was to create a themed website that housed a simple game related to that theme.

			strong Note:
			|  my aim for this project was to get as little help as possible for programming the game and the website. Thus, I did not
			| 	use any libraries or packages to aid in creating the game. I did use Google and documentation for syntax, simple logic etc. No large snippets of code were used
			| 	other than those stated below.
